## Bio


Guy Twa is a Ph.D. candidate in Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics with seven years of research experience in genetics and genomics. Experienced in processing and analyzing bulk and single-cell genomic sequence data from various model systems using statistics and machine learning approaches. Proficient in `R`, `Python`, and `Bash` programming to create and implement bioinformatics workflows for large datasets in high-performance computing cluster environments. I am passionate about understanding how genomic regulatory systems integrate and adapt to information from their environment.
